## Getting Started

To get started with the Google Docs clone, follow these steps:

1. Sign up for an account if you're a new user, or sign in if you already have an account.
2. After signing in, you'll be directed to the dashboard where you can create, edit, and delete documents.
3. Use the "Create Document" button to create a new document.
   Click on an existing document from the list to edit it.
4. Use the "Delete" button next to each document to remove it from your account.

That's it! You're now ready to use the Google Docs clone to create and collaborate on documents.

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1. **Install Yarn**: If you haven't already, install Yarn globally on your system. You can download and install Yarn from [Yarn's official website](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the project repository to your local machine using Git:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-project.git
   ```

   Replace `your-username` with your GitHub username and `your-project` with the name of your project repository.

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**: Change your current directory to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd your-project
   ```

   Replace `your-project` with the name of your project directory.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Use Yarn to install the project dependencies:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

   This command will install all the required dependencies listed in the `package.json` file.

5. **Start the Development Server**: Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the development server:

   ```bash
   yarn dev
   ```

   This command will start the development server, and you can view the project in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

6. **Ready to Go!**: You're all set! You can now begin working on the project and make any necessary modifications.
